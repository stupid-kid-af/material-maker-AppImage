Sharing materials and brushes
-----------------------------

Material Maker has a website where users can share their materials and brushes
at the following address: https://www.materialmaker.org
Pages of this website can communicate with Material Maker to transfer
materials and brushes.

Importing materials and brushes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To import materials into Material Maker, it is first necessary to open this
website using the Open Website (broken link) button in the top right corner
of the user interface. This will open this web page in your default web browser.
In the Material Maker user interface, the broken link button will change to
connected link when the page is loaded.

Opening the web site this way makes it possible to import a material from the
Materials page by simply clicking on the Open in Material Maker button. Material
Maker will automatically open the selected material in a new Project tab.

in Material Maker is a model painting project.

When you are connected, clicking on the Send material to web site button opens
a form in the web browser, where you can specify a name for your material, a few
keywords, a license and a description, and submit it. Be aware this will share
the whole graph of your material, and other Material Maker users will be able
to reuse and modify your work (which is the main purpose of the website).
