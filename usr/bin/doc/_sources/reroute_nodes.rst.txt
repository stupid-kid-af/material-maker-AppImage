Reroute nodes
-------------

Reroute nodes have no effect on the material project they are in, but can be used to
organize the graph.

To add or remove a reroute node connected to an existing port, just hold shift and
right click the port. If a reroute node is connected to that port, it will be removed,
otherwise a new reroute node will be created and connected.
